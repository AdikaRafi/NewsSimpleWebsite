## Run locally & configure API keys

Prerequisites:
- Node.js 18+ (or compatible LTS)
- npm or pnpm
- An API key for the news provider used in the project (e.g., [NewsData Apikey](https://newsdata.io/) or another provider)

Steps:
1. Clone the repo  
   git clone https://github.com/AdikaRafi/NewsSimpleWebsite.git  
   cd NewsSimpleWebsite
2. Install dependencies  
   npm install
3. Create environment file  
   Copy .env.example to .env.local (or create `.env.local`)
4. Configure required environment variables (example)
   ```
   NEWSIO_APIKEY=your_news_api_key_here
   ```
   - Keep secret keys out of commits. Use environment variables or a secrets manager in production.
5. Run development server  
   npm run dev  
   Open http://localhost:3000
6. Build for production  
   npm run build  
   npm run start (or deploy to Vercel/Netlify)

Configuring API keys:
- If you use [NewsData Apikey](https://newsdata.io/):
  - Sign up and get an API key.
  - Put the key in `NEWSIO_APIKEY` if used on client, otherwise store it server-side and proxy requests from API routes.
- If the app makes client-side requests with an API key, be aware keys are public in the browser. Prefer server-side calls for private keys.
- To reduce rate-limit issues, consider server caching or a small server-side proxy.

Troubleshooting:
- CORS/rate-limit errors: check the provider docs and verify your key and request quotas.
